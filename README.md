# React Native Assistant IA

This project is a mobile application built with **Expo React Native**, allowing users to interact with the OpenAI API using **Speech-to-Text**. Through voice commands, users can ask questions or give instructions, and the app transcribes their speech, sends it to the OpenAI API, and displays the response in a chat format.

## Features

- **Voice Interaction**: Use your device's microphone to talk to the app.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Converts audio into text that is sent to the OpenAI API for responses.
- **AI Chat**: View the conversation history in a chat format.
- **Built with Expo React Native**: The app is built with Expo for easy development and distribution.
